## Cell #4a Deep Dive: The Strategy Game

This is the **core game simulation** perfect for React adaptation. Here's what it includes:

### Game Mechanics

#### 1. **Turn-Based Gameplay**
- Max 100 steps per game
- Each turn: launch decision → collision resolution → event processing → metrics update

#### 2. **Four Orbital Layers**
- **LEO** (Low Earth Orbit): 0-50km range
  - Cheapest ($2M)
  - Satellites expire after 20 turns
  - Most vulnerable to solar flares (orbital speed: 6.4 km/s)
- **MEO** (Medium Earth Orbit): 50-100km range
  - Mid-tier cost ($3M)
  - Satellites expire after 40 turns
  - Moderate collision threshold (orbital speed: 4.0 km/s)
- **GEO** (Geostationary Orbit): 100-150km range
  - Most expensive ($5M)
  - Satellites expire after 60 turns
  - Highest collision threshold (orbital speed: 2.4 km/s)
  - Safest long-term orbit
- **GRAVEYARD** (Disposal Orbit): 150-200km range
  - No launch cost (satellites moved here by GeoTug)
  - Satellites remain indefinitely (orbital speed: 2.2 km/s)
  - End-of-life parking orbit to prevent collisions

#### 3. **Resource Management & Satellite Revenue**
The game implements a dual-revenue system combining per-satellite income with difficulty-based bonus income:

**Per-Turn Satellite Revenue (Primary):**
Each active satellite generates revenue based on its type:
- **Weather**: $100K per turn
- **Communications**: $150K per turn
- **GPS**: $200K per turn
- Example: 10 satellites (mixed types) can generate $1M-$2M per turn

**Difficulty-Based Bonus Income (Secondary):**
- **Easy Mode**: $300M starting budget, $10M bonus every 10 turns
- **Normal Mode**: $200M starting budget, $5M bonus every 20 turns
- **Hard Mode**: $150M starting budget, no bonus income (satellite revenue only)
- **Challenge Mode**: $100M starting budget, no bonus income, -$2M drain per turn

**Costs:**
- Launch costs vary by orbit (LEO: $2M, MEO: $3M, GEO: $5M, GRAVEYARD: $0)
- Optional insurance tiers:
  - None: $0 cost, $0 payout
  - Basic: $500K cost, $1M payout
  - Premium: $1M cost, $2.5M payout
- Active Debris Removal (ADR) Vehicles:
  - Cooperative ADR: $2M (LEO) to $5M (GEO)
  - Uncooperative ADR: $3.5M (LEO) to $8.75M (GEO)
  - GeoTug: $25M (all orbits) - moves satellites to GRAVEYARD
  - Servicing: $1.5M (LEO) to $3.75M (GEO) - extends satellite/ADR lifespan

**Economic Strategy:** Your satellite fleet is your primary revenue engine. Launch high-value GPS satellites early to build steady income. Protect revenue-generating satellites with insurance. In Easy/Normal modes, time expensive launches after bonus income. In Hard/Challenge modes, build satellite revenue quickly to sustain operations.

#### 4. **Satellite Types**
- **Weather** satellites
- **Communications** satellites
- **GPS** satellites
- **Random** (10% discount on launch cost)
- Each type tracked separately for mission objectives

#### 5. **Risk System**
- **🟢 LOW**: <150 debris
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: 150-300 debris
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: >300 debris
- Risk affects collision probability and mission success

#### 6. **Random Events**
- **Solar Flares**: 10% chance per turn, classified by intensity (A, B, C, M, X)
  - **Class A**: Removes ~5% of LEO debris (most common)
  - **Class B**: Removes ~10% of LEO debris (common)
  - **Class C**: Removes ~20% of LEO debris (moderate)
  - **Class M**: Removes ~35% of LEO debris + ~5% of MEO debris (rare)
  - **Class X**: Removes ~50% of LEO debris + ~20% of MEO debris + ~5% of GEO debris (very rare)
  - Strategic benefit/opportunity for debris cleanup
  - Intensity affects orbital speed multipliers during the event
- **Collision Cascades**: Triggered by 3+ simultaneous collisions
  - Creates rapid debris multiplication
  - Game-ending scenario if not managed

#### 7. **Collision Mechanics**
- Layer-specific proximity thresholds (LEO: 10, MEO: 15, GEO: 20)
- Each collision generates 5 debris pieces
- Debris persists between turns
- Satellite destruction on collision

#### 8. **Mission System**
13 possible missions, 3 randomly selected per game:
- **GPS_3_by_20**: Launch 3 GPS satellites by turn 20
- **10x_LOW_RISK**: Maintain LOW risk for 10 consecutive turns
- **All_3_Layers**: Launch into all orbital layers
- **Balanced_Deployment**: 5+ satellites per orbit
- **Insurance_Strategist**: Get 3 insurance payouts without exceeding medium risk
- **Skip_Steps**: Skip launching for 5 total turns
- **No_Cascades**: Avoid collision cascades entirely
- **Debris_Dropper**: Reduce debris below 50 after exceeding 200
- **Danger_Survivor**: Survive 5 CRITICAL risk steps
- **Sustainable_Skies**: End with <100 debris and >10 satellites
- **Natural_Retirement**: Let 3 LEO satellites expire naturally
- **Orbital_Streak**: Launch into same orbit 5 consecutive times
- **GPS_Priority**: Keep GPS as ≥30% of active satellites

### State Management Approach

**Recommended**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand

**Why?**
- Complex game state with many interdependencies
- Time-travel debugging valuable for turn-based game
- Clear action/reducer pattern matches simulation steps
- Easy to implement undo/redo for player experience

### Core Actions

```javascript
// Player actions
LAUNCH_SATELLITE
SKIP_TURN

// Simulation actions
PROCESS_COLLISIONS
AGE_SATELLITES
TRIGGER_SOLAR_EVENT
UPDATE_METRICS
CHECK_MISSIONS
END_GAME

// UI actions

## Technical Translation Guide

### Python → JavaScript Conversions

| Python Pattern | React Implementation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `random.choice()` | `Math.random()` + array indexing |
| `random.uniform(a, b)` | `a + Math.random() * (b - a)` |
| `matplotlib plotting` | Chart.js / Recharts / Victory |
| `ipywidgets buttons` | React button components |
| `print()` statements | Event log component |
| Global state variables | React Context / Redux |
| Step loop | `useTurn()` hook with game loop |

### Collision Detection

```javascript
function checkCollision(sat1, sat2) {
  if (sat1.layer !== sat2.layer) return false;
  
  const dx = sat1.x - sat2.x;
  const dy = sat1.y - sat2.y;
  const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  
  const threshold = CONFIG.too_close_thresholds[sat1.layer];
  return distance < threshold;
}
```

### Position Generation

```javascript
function randomPositionInLayer(layer) {
  const x = Math.random() * 100;
  const [yMin, yMax] = CONFIG.layer_bounds[layer];
  const y = yMin + Math.random() * (yMax - yMin);
  return { x, y };
}
```

## Visualization Recommendations

### 2D Orbital View (Primary)

**Technology**: Canvas API or SVG

**Layout**:
- Concentric circles representing orbital layers
- Color-coded by layer (LEO: blue, MEO: green, GEO: orange)
- Satellites as distinct sprites/icons
- Debris as smaller particles
- Collision effects with animations

**Advantages**:
- Simple to implement
- Clear visibility of all objects
- Easy to add UI overlays
- Performant for 100+ objects

### Optional 3D View

**Technology**: Three.js or React-Three-Fiber

**Use Case**: 
- Optional "beauty mode" visualization
- End-game replay
- Marketing/showcase feature

**Note**: The notebook's #4b cell shows 3D implementation, but 2D is recommended for gameplay due to clarity.

## Game Loop Implementation

```javascript
function useGameSimulation() {
  const [gameState, dispatch] = useReducer(gameReducer, initialState);
  
  const executeTurn = useCallback((launchDecision) => {
    // 1. Launch satellite if chosen
    if (launchDecision.orbit) {
      dispatch({ 
        type: 'LAUNCH_SATELLITE', 
        payload: launchDecision 
      });
    }
    
    // 2. Age satellites and handle expirations
    dispatch({ type: 'AGE_SATELLITES' });
    
    // 3. Detect and process collisions
    dispatch({ type: 'PROCESS_COLLISIONS' });
    
    // 4. Random events (solar storms)
    if (Math.random() < CONFIG.solar_activity_chance) {
      dispatch({ type: 'TRIGGER_SOLAR_EVENT' });
    }
    
    // 5. Update metrics and risk
    dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_METRICS' });
    
    // 6. Check mission progress
    dispatch({ type: 'CHECK_MISSIONS' });
    
    // 7. Check end conditions
    if (shouldEndGame(gameState)) {
      dispatch({ type: 'END_GAME' });
    }
  }, [gameState]);
  
  return { gameState, executeTurn };
}
```
